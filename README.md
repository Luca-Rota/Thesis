Title: Decentralized Identity Management: Building and Integrating a Self-Sovereign Identity Framework.

Abstract:
In the era of technology transition, the traditional concept of identity has been redefined, giving rise to digital identity. This important shift in the identity management is setting the 
need for reconsidering how we treat the identities. The most feasible solution in this context is the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is a model designed to put identity under the 
control of individuals.
This master's thesis, conducted at the Links Foundation, delves into the growing world of SSI within decentralized systems. By using blockchain technology and a tool called 
MetaMask,a SSI standalone framework has been developed and later integrated into the Data Cellar project of Links Foundation, showcasing its real-world utility. Going 
through the aspects related to cryptography and cybersecurity, the research ends in a decentralized application (DApp), combining an easy-to-use interface (developed with 
React and JavaScript) with a robust foundation (built using NestJs), for a secure and user-centric authentication.
While the decentralized identities discussions keep on evolving, this thesis fits in the ongoing discourse, emphasizing the pivotal role of blockchain technology 
in creating self-sovereign identity solutions and at the same time supports the commitment of Links Foundation's to digital innovation.
