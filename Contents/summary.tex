In the fast-paced landscape of digital evolution, the concept of identity undergoes a paradigm shift from centralized control to self-sovereignty. 

This thesis, which was carried out at Links Foundation, delves into the exciting and transformative 
landscape of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) within the realm of decentralized identity management. 

By utilizing blockchain technology and the powerful MetaMask tool, a standalone SSI framework has been developed 
to seamless integrate with Links Foundation's Data Cellar project, showcasing practical and real-world 
applications. With a focus on cryptographic and cybersecurity aspects, this research ultimately culminates 
in a decentralized application (DApp) that boasts a combination of sophisticated frontend design (based on 
React and JavaScript) and a robust backend system (built with NestJs) for ensuring secure and user-centric 
authentication processes. 

This valuable work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the potential of 
decentralized identity, aligning perfectly with Links Foundation's dedicated efforts towards digital innovation.
