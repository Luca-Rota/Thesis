In the revolution of technology that is known in this era, identity has transitioned from its original forms to the digital area. Such change in paradigm requires the 
re-evaluation of identity management issues and in this context the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the most relevant concept.

This thesis, conducted at Links Foundation, investigates the evolving ecosystem of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in the context of decentralized identity management. 
Employing the blockchain technology and MetaMask, a SSI standalone framework is developed and later integrated into the Data Cellar project of Links Foundation, thus showing practical usability.
By digging into thoroughly cryptographic and cybersecurity aspects, the research ends in a decentralized application (DApp),combining a frontend 
elegance (React, JS) and a robust backend (NestJs) for secure and user-centric authentication.

Decentralized identity is an area of ongoing discussion, and this work falls in line with Links Foundation direction of digital innovation.
