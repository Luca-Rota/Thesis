In the evolving world the concept of identity is going through a significant change. The concept of identity undergoes a paradigm shift from centralized control to 
self-sovereignty. 

This thesis, conducted at Links Foundation explores the realm of \gls{ssi} in identity management. By leveraging technology and the powerful MetaMask tool we have developed 
a SSI framework that seamlessly integrates with Links Foundations Data Cellar project. This framework showcases real world applications. The thesis focuses on cybersecurity 
aspects and culminates in a \gls{dapp}. The DApp combines frontend design using React and JavaScript with a backend system built with NestJs to ensure secure and user 
centric authentication processes. 

This valuable work contributes to the discussion about the potential of identity aligning perfectly with Links Foundations commitment, to digital innovation.
