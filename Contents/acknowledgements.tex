Before proceeding with the discussion, I would like to dedicate a few lines to all those who have been close to me in this path of personal and professional growth.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Bazzanella and my co-advisor Meneguzzo, who were always ready to give me the right guidance, at every stage of the realization of the thesis. 

I am grateful to the Links Foundation, for giving me the opportunity to do my thesis work in a dynamic place and gain an experience that will be invaluable for my future. 

I thank infinitely my mother, father, sister, and the rest of my family; without their constant support and teachings, I would not be who I am today. Without you, this would not have been possible.

Heartfelt thanks also go to my girlfriend, Beatrice, for her patience, understanding and unwavering sustenance during this journey. Her trust in me has been a constant source of motivation.

To my old friends in Liguria and my new friends in Turin; thank you for loving me for who I am, for always being by my side, and for all the carefree times we spent together.

Finally, I dedicate this thesis to myself and to my sacrifices and tenacity that have allowed me to get this far.
